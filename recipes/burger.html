  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Chicken burgers are notoriously dry, but not anymore! Adding minced roasted mushrooms to ground chicken not only adds extra moisture, it gives a deep umami flavor that even beef lovers will drool over. A little more time-intensive than a regular burger, this version is oozing with flavor and well worth the extra effort–crunchy, tangy, sweet, savory and juicy, all in one burger.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    <li>1 small carrot, cut into matchsticks</li>
    <li>1/4 small red onion</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Sriracha, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>4 brioche buns, split</li>
    <li>1 pund ground chicken</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Whisk together 3/4 cups rice vinegar, water, sugar, and sesame seeds in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add carrot, cucumber, and red onion, separating onion layers; toss to coat. Chill until ready to use, stirring occasionally to keep vegetables submerged in the brine.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Toss mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil. Spread mushrooms out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast mushrooms in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove from oven and allow to cool.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining oil in a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Fry burgers until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 3 minutes per side. Place patties on a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Spread a light layer of Bang Bang sauce on bottom buns. Add 2 charred jalapeño halves per bun. Add chicken patty and top with slaw and charred scallions. Top with cilantro and drizzle with more sauce.</li>
  </ol>
